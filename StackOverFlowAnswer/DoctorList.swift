    // Function to parse the JSON file and add it to array of doctorList and pass it back.
    /* Do not worry first about the complexity of this method. This is pretty straight forward. Let me guide you step by step.
     
     1. First forget about completion completionHandler: ([DoctorList]) -> () code.
         so think as --- static func doctorList() method as this. pretty simple yes!!
     2. Parse the JSON file. You already know how to do it. If not then you have to go back and look :):)
         pretty boring
     3. Since we may have a number of doctors so create array of DoctorList
     4. Iterate through each element of JSON
         Since the key is "list", I am using it to make an array Of dictionary of [String: Any type].
         oops alot of thing.
     5. Create doctorList object
     6. Set the values from JSON to doctorList object.
         Note: this method will take you above to setValue method. It will check the key. If key is "Schedule" then it will append to DoctorList.Schedule array. If not then it will append to doctorList array. Just think it does.
     7. Append all doctorList to doctorsList array.
         Note: Do not get confused with doctorList (This one is object of DoctorList) and doctorsList (This one is array of DoctorList)
     
     8. Call the completion handler to pass doctorList array.
     We need this in ViewController class to set doctorsList array that is defined in ViewController class
     
     ------ Code in viewDidLoad() in ViewController slass
         DoctorList.doctorList { (doctorsList) in
         self.doctorsList = doctorsList;
         }

            let data = try Data(contentsOf: file!); //Get content of file
            
            let json = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: .mutableContainers) as! [String:Any]; // Get data as json object
            
            var doctorsList = [DoctorList](); //Look step 3
            
            for data in json["list"] as! [[String: Any]]{ //Loop through all the array of objects. Step 4

                doctorList.setValuesForKeys(data); //Step 6
                
                doctorsList.append(doctorList); //Step 7
